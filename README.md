By using this software, you pledge that your organization spends at
least 5% of its software engineering budget toward the development of
open-source software.

Intent
--

The desire to eliminate repetitive manual labor is what drives
good software engineers. The need to reimplement the same software
when moving to another company goes against this goal.
We believe it doesn't have to be that way. We want to:

* Make software technology evolve faster.
* Reduce reimplementation costs across organizations.
* Make the life of software engineers more meaningful.

Expectations
--

* Organizations and their employees will publicize their estimated
  percentage of contribution to open-source software.
* Good software engineers will seek employment preferentially in
  compliant companies.

Applicability
--

The open-source honor code defines a moral obligation, which applies
to individuals. It's not a legal obligation.

Let's consider some 3rd-party open-source software X that comes with
the open-source honor code.
In general, the honor code **applies** in the following case:

* Software X is used by the organization when asking a software
  engineer working for the organization "Do we use X?" and the answer
  is yes.

In general, the honor code is **does not apply** in the following cases:

* Software X is used by the organization when asking to a software
  engineer working for the organization "Do we use X?" and the answer
  is no or "we don't know".
* Software X is only a dependency of another open-source piece of software
  distributed by the organization which is not used by people within the
  organization and which is not bundled with proprietary software developed
  by the organization.
