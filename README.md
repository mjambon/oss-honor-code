                      Open-Source Honor Code

By using this software, you pledge that your organization spends at
least 5% of its software engineering budget toward the development of
open-source software.

THIS IS NOT A LEGALLY-BINDING DOCUMENT.
For more information, visit https://github.com/mjambon/oss-honor-code
```

The recommended use is to display this notice prominently in
your project's source code, documentation, and executables.
In the source tree, we recommend placing its contents in a file named
[`HONOR-CODE`](samples/HONOR-CODE) in the same folder as licensing
information.

The percentage of an organization's software engineering budget spent
toward the development of open-source software is called **BOSS Score**,
which stands for "booster of open-source software". For example, if a
company has a policy that every software engineer is encouraged to
spend 4 hours a week on developing in-house or external open-source
software, its estimated BOSS Score is 10%. The honor code requires a
minimum BOSS score of 5%.

Intent
--

The desire to eliminate repetitive manual labor is what drives
productive software engineers. The need to reimplement the same type
of software when changing jobs goes against this goal.
We believe it doesn't have to be that way. We want to:

* Make software technology evolve faster.
* Reduce reimplementation costs across organizations.
* Make the life of software engineers more meaningful.

Expectations
--

* Organizations and their employees will publicize their BOSS Score.
* Good software engineers will seek employment preferentially in
  compliant companies.

Applicability
--

The open-source honor code defines a moral obligation, which applies
to individuals. It's not a legal obligation.

Let's consider some 3rd-party open-source software X that comes with
the open-source honor code.
In general, the honor code **applies** in the following case:

* Software X is used by the organization when asking a software
  engineer working for the organization "Do we use X?" and the answer
  is yes.

In general, the honor code is **does not apply** in the following cases:

* Software X is used by the organization when asking to a software
  engineer working for the organization "Do we use X?" and the answer
  is no or "we don't know".
* Software X is only a dependency of another open-source piece of software
  distributed by the organization which is not used by people within the
  organization and which is not bundled with proprietary software developed
  by the organization.

Enforcement
--

The honor code is not a legal contract, it is a moral
contract. Individuals are responsible for its enforcement for
everyone's benefit.

* Spread the word about the open-source honor code.
* Report violations within your team to your supervisor.
* Report violations within your organization to your human resources
  department.
* Explain what to do for the organization to be compliant.
* Propose steps toward compliance.
* If the violation persists, bring it up to your human resources
  department if you haven't done so already.
* Let others know (supervisor, HR, direct colleagues, outsiders)
  that you do not wish to jeopardize your reputation by being
  associated with violators of the honor code.
* Publicize your estimate of your organization's BOSS Score.
* Don't join organizations suspected to violate the honor code.
* Provide technical support only to members of compliant
  organizations.

Employee FAQ
--

### Would the honor code prevent some good people from using my software?

Unfortunately yes, if they work for uncooperative organizations.
Even people who develop open-source software within their organization
won't be able to use your software if their organization doesn't
invest sufficiently in open-source software development.

### Can I fork a project and remove the honor code notice?

Legally yes, morally no. It is against the spirit of the honor code to
do so. This would make you an evil person.

### Can I fork a project and add the honor code notice?

No, unless the authors agree to do so.

### Can I update the honor code notice in future versions of my software?

Yes, but it won't be retroactive. It would be dishonest to expect
users of a previous version of your software to obey a future
version of the honor code.

### Are authors of software distributed with the honor code bound to it?

Generally, yes. You should not expect other organizations to obey an
honor code that your own organization doesn't obey. You should give
the false impression that your organization obey the open-source honor
code.

### Can I make closed-source software subject to the open-source honor code?

Yes. Nonetheless, your organization is expected to comply with
open-source honor code.

### What if some contributors belong to non-compliant organizations?

The main organization or individual that leads the project is
what matters. Occasional third-party contributors, including
individuals from non-compliant organizations, are not expected to be
bound to the open-source honor code.

Employer FAQ
--

### Is this a license agreement?

No. Please consult the licensing terms for each piece of software
independently.

### Can our organization legally ignore this honor code?

Yes, if your organization is evil.

### The language is vague. How is it enforceable?

It is meant to be enforced voluntarily, relying on the good faith of
individuals. Only your reputation as an employer and the reputation of
your employees are at stake.

### How can our organization become compliant?

Here are a few suggestions.

* Open-source your in-house components that are sufficiently generic.
* Create a company-wide policy in each software engineer is
  encouraged to devote some fraction of their time, say between 2 and
  4 hours a week, to contributing to open-source projects. Have their
  manager discuss specific projects and how these efforts benefit the
  company in addition to benefitting the community.
* Open-source the work of a whole team. This fits companies where one
  or more team is dedicated to developing internal tools. Making those
  tools public is a great way to give back to the community, to
  showcase technical excellence, and to benefit from external
  contributions.
* Organize a monthly event during which all programmers at the company
  will contribute to selected open-source projects. This could be in
  the form of bug hunting, fixing known bugs in 3rd-party
  applications, writing documentation, etc.
